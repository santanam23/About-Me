# About Me

This weeks goal was to create a Porfolio Webpage that illustrated out HTML Porfolio, along with information about us.

I created a web page that illustrated About Me content and Work Experience.

The first step in the process was to create a sketch of what kind of page I wanted to create. 

I choose the color sketch and then went on to create the rest of the content. 

I added a header to my page, along with the flex function

I also added an image of myself to the start of the page.
